## Aphids:
## (Hemiptera or Aphidiae) Plant Draining Devastations
Aphids, those soft-bodied sap-suckers, can be a real thorn in the side of any botanist cultivating a thriving indoor haven. 
Here's a closer look at these green (or sometimes black, brown, yellow, or red) menaces:
<br> Strong Water Spray: A forceful blast of water can dislodge aphids from your plants. While effective for light infestations, 
repeat applications might be needed, and it's not suitable for delicate plants.
<br>  Insecticidal Soap Sprays: Similar to whiteflies, insecticidal soap sprays (fatty acid salts) 
can be effective against aphids. Coat the undersides of leaves thoroughly, paying attention to areas where aphids congregate.
<br> Neem Oil Spray: Neem oil, a botanical insecticide, can disrupt aphid feeding and act as a repellent. Be sure to follow dilution instructions and avoid using in hot weather as it can damage leaves.
<br> Beneficial Insects: Introduce natural predators like ladybugs, lacewings, or parasitic wasps to your indoor garden if possible. 
These beneficial insects feed on aphids, helping to control populations organically.
<br> Pruning and Monitoring:  For heavily infested areas, prune and remove badly 
affected leaves or stems.  This helps reduce the aphid population and removes potential egg-laying sites.
Regularly monitor your plants for signs of aphids, especially new growth.
<br> Identification:  These tiny insects, typically 1/8 inch long, congregate on the undersides of leaves, stems, and new growth.  
Look for their pear-shaped bodies and grouping patterns, most likely seen on stems than other pests.  
Their presence might also be revealed by sticky honeydew secretions on leaves (this signals the plant immune response), 
or the presence of ants.
<br> Botanical Blood Feast:  Aphids pierce plant tissues with their needle-like mouthparts and suck out sap. This weakens the plant and hinders its growth.  
The honeydew they excrete can also attract other pests like sooty mold, further compromising plant health.


## Spider Mites 
## (Acari: Tetranychidae): Microscopic Menace
Identification: These eight-legged arachnids are minuscule, typically under 0.5 mm, making them difficult to spot with the naked eye. Look for webbing on the undersides of leaves 
and stippling (yellowish or bronzed) damage on the upper surfaces.
Feeding Mechanism: Spider mites pierce plant cell walls with their chelicerae (modified mouthparts) and suck out the contents, primarily chlorophyll.
Plant Vulnerability:  While some plants are more resistant, water-stressed or nutrient-deficient specimens are particularly susceptible to spider mite infestations.

<br> Review have I tried this? no not yet
<br> PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION --> just flip the plant upside, spray down with water generously, have spiders as a natural predator..
<br>A regular washing with a firm jet of water (syringing) can help keep populations down. 
<br>Several of the insecticidal soaps/oils can be effective, but must be very very thoroughly applied to the upper and lower leaf surfaces. 
<br> Applications will have to be repeated two to three times in order to kill resistant eggs and resting stages of this pest. 
<br> Also note: Two-spotted spider mites are notorious for developing resistance to miticides.

## Fungus Gnats 
## (Sciaridae & Mycetophilidae): Spoilsports of the Soil
<br> Fungus gnats, those tiny flying nuisances buzzing
<br> Identification:  Fungus gnats are small (1/8 inch) flying insects with dark or grayish bodies, long antennae, and dark-colored translucent wings folded flat over their backs. Look for them hovering near houseplants or flitting around windows.
The trouble starts with adult gnats laying eggs in moist potting soil, The larvae are translucent with black heads and munch on algae, fungi, and unfortunately, tender plant roots. After a few molts, they pupate in the soil and emerge as adult fungus gnats, continuing the cycle.
Botanical Concerns:  While adult gnats are harmless, their larvae can damage plant roots, hindering nutrient and water uptake.eases, examples will see the high infestations can even cause seedlings to “damp off” and die.
<br> Solutions 
Nematological Nemesis:  Here's where your botanical knowledge shines! Utilize beneficial nematodes, 
microscopic worm-like predators available at garden centers. Specifically, target species like Steinernema feltiae or celana. 
These nematodes actively seek out and devour fungus gnat larvae in the soil, offering a natural and effective control method.
Water Wisely:  Overwatering is the root cause! Fungus gnats thrive in moist environments. 
Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. 
This disrupts the gnat's life cycle and as it becomes less optimal for egg-laying.
<br>
<br> Review have I tried this? somewhat, overwatering definitely is the cause, but in online you can also buy yellow sticky traps, 
<br> and also to water much less frequently and also use very <b>small amount 3% H2O2<b/> weekly, this serves a dual purpose, as it kills
<br> any early stage mites, while also loosening up soil and both adding aeration but also providing pores for the water to 
<br> enter and leave quicker through evaporation, loosens up clay like soil.

## Less often encountered indoors
## Slugs, Isopods, 
<br> to add to this section in the future... 
<br>
<br> MY PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION is inside, use the amazon uv vacuum traps, , watering with hydrogen peroxide, and natural predators (aka volunteer a spider from outside and bring in to keep pest levels down)
<br> PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION, also the cheapest by far, is the 12%
