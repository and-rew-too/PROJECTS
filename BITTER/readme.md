## Barometric Pressure Testing Introduction and Relevant Links

Birds were put into custom-built Plexiglas chambers (32×30.5×32 cm outside, 30.5×29×30.5 cm inside; University of Texas machine shop, Austin, TX, USA) fitted with several doors (for entry into the cage and for food and water) and several ports for gas flow and pressure measurements. All doors were sealed with O-rings and ports with airtight bulkhead fittings.

The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1A. Chambers were ventilated by ~3 l min−1 CO2-free air, which was pulled by a vacuum system and controlled by an upstream solenoid valve. 
CO2-free air was produced by a gas generator (PureGas, Broomfield, CO, USA) at 3.5–4 l min−1 and pushed to an overflow bypass. The vacuum pulled air from the overflow through the bird 
chamber and then through a Venturi flow tube, which we used as a flow meter. The Venturi tube consisted of two copper tubes soldered together with a short, conical copper connector; 
the upstream tube was larger (7.2 mm diameter) than the downstream tube (4.5 mm). Each section had a port drilled into it to which short pieces of small brass tubing were fitted. 
These two lines were then connected to a differential pressure meter (PT-100B, Sable Systems, Las Vegas, NV, USA).

PT-100B
Venturi Tube
PureGas gas generator
Vacuum pump
Solenoid Valve
Calibrated fixed rotameter 10L/min

The arrangement was calibrated by simultaneously measuring flow rate of air (with a calibrated fixed rotameter, max. 10L/min) and differential pressure in the Venturi tube 
(with the differential pressure meter). As expected, the relationship between flow and differential pressure was exponential (Fig. 1B); to linearize, we log transformed both 
sides (Fig. 1B, inset). The relationship was highly repeatable across days (the calibration includes measurements from multiple days).
