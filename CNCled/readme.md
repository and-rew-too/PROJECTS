A group of LEDs designed to be safe (current limited and overtemp protected), high efficiency (operates at 12V and unknown forward voltage), and bright enough to grow indoor plants year round.
<br> Every folder within this repo will also contain a README, which is intended to explain, at first glance, what a project does and how to install or test the code. If applicable the folders will have these following sections.
