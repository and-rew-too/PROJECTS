A group of five-MG996 servos lined up in individual wooden compartments, with a TOF sensor set to trigger the corresponding servo when a step-response is measured at the appropriate distance.

<br> Filtering and advanced digital signal processining from EECS123 and related textbook material

## Introduction and Relevant Links
Power and Signal! should both be 5V, but currently what I have for the arduino nano is it is set to 3.3V logic, so less than the supply voltage of servo.  
<br> Important: include commercial alternative links here

## BOM
See bom above, still incomplete

## CAD Files

## Gerber (PCB) Files
KiCad file name is 021223-TEAVL53L0X-test
To be completed, Still need to wire up final 5V voltage pins out to the motors


## Descriptions??

## Results and Improvements
</br>Increase overall capacity? by using <3" wide glasses that are taller and can hold more than one cup
</br> Include silicone seal around a grooved/insert wooden lid on top to improve the airtight seal and storage time of the contents inside
