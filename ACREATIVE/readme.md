## Arousal Theory
There is optimal arousal theories, regarding the type of arousal we seek 
This is linked later, to flow, which itself is also linked to "selfish" mastery and the creative endeavours. Optimal arousal depends on two things, the type of work or divergent thinking being undertaken, and also by the type of historical arousal that a personal has good experiences with before. 

<br> My pet theory, is that humans have a select amount of innate stimuli preferences (similar to innate fears), but in general humans are encultured or create associations to specific environments, which also boost positive creativity. A classic example is the low coffee shop hum of mainly other people and chatter noises. 
<br> Also stimulants tend to enahnce task positive and 'laser' like attention while I bevlie . Things like modafonil or caffeine for productivity boosts but few on health and cognition changes in short-term and long-term scales. Personally I belive (on the flip side the balmer's curve for moderate alcohol use is real) Going back to the dmn versus positive task attentional networks in the brain. Also, relating to behavioral ways to change attention, there's very mixed results on how meditation affects creativity, so I personally don't meditate at all, find my mind becomes too... stable almost not enough free flowing ideas jumping in and connecting. 
<br> <br> I believe optimal arousal isn't just to a few stimuli, but optimal arousal even increases when multiple senses ... For example nature is an ambience but it's not just visual it's rarely replicated. I mean if it was you'd find artists coming up with breakthroughs in the Rainforest Cafe... it's lacking something else, like the earthy smell or the natural lighting filter through a canopy. 
<br> Somehow, nature has less threatening stimuli, increased abundance of various stimuli, and studies show how Nature generally improves mood, attention, memory, and overall divergent thinking scores, albeit a low affect. Is there something to do with  the low threat sounds of wind or birdsong? Something with the optimum olfactory responses to monoterepenes etc? [source1](idkyet)
## Welcome to My Website


<br> Not only is arousal dependant on the stimulus type, but also reflects the type of emotional affect those arousing stimuli... This can be achieved through existing emotional states, or influenced directly by stimuli like music or aesthetics [source2](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182210)
> Overstimulation provoked by the environmental complexity would lead to (1) a decrease in exploratory behaviors toward complexity, (2) an increase in exploratory behaviors toward simplicity (e.g. focus on the classroom posters rather than the teacher lesson), and (3) an increase in creative thinking skills aimed to create simpler stimuli such as convergent thinking (e.g. asking the teacher for clarification or doodling). It is important to note that if overstimulation becomes more stressful, creative behaviors because they depend on cognition, may be negatively affected (even if the motivation would remain high).

> Understimulation provoked by a dull environment would lead to (1) a decrease in exploratory behaviors toward simple stimuli, (2) an increase in exploratory behaviors toward complexity or novelty (e.g. focus on the teacher lesson rather than the classroom posters), and (3) an increase in thinking skills aimed at creating complex stimuli such as divergent thinking (e.g. asking the teacher open questions, or finding a pun).



## Background Priming Creatiivity 

### Natural World
STUDY HERE... primed later to , and before either primed with a urban setting, nature setting, and ten .... finally the control video and shockingly some amount of stimulus especially nature stimulus perfrmed the best in a Alternate tasks Test to grade divergent thinking and creativity. 


### Red light general, also
Studies here.. forthcoming

### OPTIMUM TEMP, Cold a little more Ptroductive
There is a optimum for sure, and actually found any temps cold, or temps below this optimum for creativity we acutally become better attentional and better engaged in task... Begs the question, what is changing in the biological sense in terms of neurons firing or gene expression?? And what happens if temps rise above this optimum what thinking processes end up changing in that direction? 

### Mentioned, High Ceilings
This is the so called Cathedral effect... no fMRI or more substantial evidence

<br> Details regarding this board, its dimensions 48" x 36", four glass holes to mount, not too thick, mounted using metal mounts and ?? screws, and magnetic, easy to clean due to the glass surface... very reflective wahhh the downside it is too reflective.

### Black Space Aesthetic
Personally believe that even the way information's presented, is of optimal importance. Highly visual relation to creative tasks as in the occipital cortex lights up during fMRI of improvisational 'savants' or 'piano jazz players',
<br> Just as we internally think visually, we also are highly susceptible to the way the visual text or images are oriented, I feel that that serve as a top-down visual cue to our cortical areas to reorient our attention...
<br> As an example, I find myself, from reduced eye strain, or from the inversion from the typical white background black-focused print of books and online articles. That the inversion significantly helps me with focusing on spaces inbetween words. It's like it forces my attentional and thinking patterns to shift and expand that search light. 

<br> Find analagous forms in other cultures, for example in carved stone calligraphy in Taiwanese culture, find that the typical red ink on carved stone is like a stamp calligraphy, it many artistic implications. Within stamp calligraphy the two main forms are yin and yang, with the the yang technique has the words inhabiting the 'positive' and this is achieved through a emboss of the characters carved into stone. And the yin technique has the words inhabiting the 'negative' on the printed page so the deboss of the character is carved into the stone. And so the same effect as having a black background in print is also achieved. The philosophy on when and why calligraphists choose yin or yang print, is lost on me... I don't know enough yet 
<br> A last note as well, anecdotally physics professors have , it's chalk or die for them, whether that is stubbornness linked to traditions and mentors, or a deeper underlying preference for expansive attention to solve creatively, who's to say? 




## DMN Examples
### DMN Felt when left Alone
Will either ruminate heavily or instead be "lost" in daydreaming. 
Rumination can be dangerous and can quickly fall into negative self talk and start spiraling. 
<br> Or judge the inside to be much more fulfilling and interesting than the outside world, and actively create 
Anecodtally, but also this is what the major brain structures for the DMN correspond to, which is self referential thinking, social relation thinking, future planning, and mind wandering... 

### DMN dysfunction
DMN dysfunciton, typical , dysfunctions found specifically in bipolar disorder, more genetic link and reproductible changes across people versus other DSM/RDoC diagnoses, and through bipolar see small but statitically significant increases in creativity/divergent thinking. 

### DMN Salience Network
Going above above, think again about the expansive flashlight version of attention where in a positive affect and in a non threatening situation you are free to let mind wander and generate more complex stimuli... and the ideas of gating attention have a neurological basis, particularly linked to salience network which not only manages , but also . This ties into a later, more recent larger neuroscience , where the catechecolamines (in addition other gaba or ach nicotinic etc neurotransmitters) act fundamentally as a weight/cue to the degree ,and it's through , it's not that the emotions are fundamentally embodied in specific . 

<br> Interestingly as well, dACC it's long been considered to be the source, if you will, of sadness behavior and through natural lesions from people who had undergone brain strokes versios damage etc, it was unexpected. It was thought that if people with dACC impaired then they shouldn't cry at all or feel any sadness, but instead what happened. Instead more interestingly, they became unable to control the valence, the severity of their response to ,... find paper again here.... This lends even more evidence towards the theory that Salience Network is a modulator and gater of , before sending it to the higher level cortical areas that will encode any learning and rewards/avoidance behavior to prepare for future responses this ... and that similar emotions then get grouped together to get activated together as a form of learning a good heuristic to process and respond better for overall increased fitness.  "say group all fearful responses because we can then react faster to avoid these stimuli" "say group all endearing responses because that way we know that the object of endearment needs to be comforted and cared for"
<br> And this, by gating the emotions necessary, we also gate a specific emotional state to prime for anything creative... 
<br> Very interestingly, the more creative thinking we engage in the more of a positive affect we feel, so creativity in itself can be , and creativity seems to have (although with insight like PIIV there's the negative and positive affect working together)

### DMN trained, but
I tried NYT Connections, really found creative solutions in the groupings in this word association game, and I was feeling it train creatiivty forsure but didn't feel something deeper I guess, the puzzle was solved sure but not satisfying or self gratifying... unlike other times I had felt creative... 
<br> needs to be a purpose, need insight as creativity ultimatly goal is to be involved in real-world problems actually. 


### Anecdotes - artistry Creativitiy
Australian study, across multiple jobs, and also wide rnage of ages, asking where their insights happened most often, ranked in order it would go from at night/in bed > at work > during transport > in nature > etc etc 
<br> Most often, very little while exercising or engaging in task-positive, always during times of rumination, or times during which DMN functional connectivity is changing (LIKE right before falling asleep lol) 
<br> That marshy swap, liminal space between slumber and wakefulness. 


Artistry, from being left alone and left to ruminate...

Neils Bohr came to him in a dream!! bro!! 

Great, thought somehow, actually within

Anecdote also, randomly, dreaming being to dream in the lanauge, and then create novel sentences easily just needed to immerse self so fully in a language until it like clicks subconsciouslly ... this was from the youtube video comments.
Anecdote also, after being a geek for a few months parroting languages, will then move to really absorb it from Dash, and then in turn had a dream where you're dreaming the language, and shortly thereafter find new novel ways to "liberate" money and trading opportunities.
