## Arousal Theory
There is optimal arousal theories, regarding the type of arousal we seek 
This is linked later, to flow, which itself is also linked to "selfish" mastery and the creative endeavours. Optimal arousal depends on two things, the type of work or divergent thinking being undertaken, and also by the type of historical arousal that a personal has good experiences with before. 

<br> My pet theory, is that humans have a select amount of innate stimuli preferences (similar to innate fears), but in general humans are encultured or create associations to specific environments, which also boost positive creativity. A classic example is the low coffee shop hum of mainly other people and chatter noises. 
<br> Also stimulants tend to enahnce task positive and 'laser' like attention while I bevlie . Things like modafonil or caffeine for productivity boosts but few on health and cognition changes in short-term and long-term scales. Personally I belive (on the flip side the balmer's curve for moderate alcohol use is real) Going back to the dmn versus positive task attentional networks in the brain. Also, relating to behavioral ways to change attention, there's very mixed results on how meditation affects creativity, so I personally don't meditate at all, find my mind becomes too... stable almost not enough free flowing ideas jumping in and connecting. 
<br> <br> I believe optimal arousal isn't just to a few stimuli, but optimal arousal even increases when multiple senses ... For example nature is an ambience but it's not just visual it's rarely replicated. I mean if it was you'd find artists coming up with breakthroughs in the Rainforest Cafe... it's lacking something else, like the earthy smell or the natural lighting filter through a canopy. 
<br> Somehow, nature has less threatening stimuli, increased abundance of various stimuli, and studies show how Nature generally improves mood, attention, memory, and overall divergent thinking scores, albeit a low affect. Is there something to do with  the low threat sounds of wind or birdsong? Something with the optimum olfactory responses to monoterepenes etc? [source1](idkyet)

<br> Not only is arousal dependant on the stimulus type, but also reflects the type of emotional affect those arousing stimuli... This can be achieved through existing emotional states, or influenced directly by stimuli like music or aesthetics [source2](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182210)
> Overstimulation provoked by the environmental complexity would lead to (1) a decrease in exploratory behaviors toward complexity, (2) an increase in exploratory behaviors toward simplicity (e.g. focus on the classroom posters rather than the teacher lesson), and (3) an increase in creative thinking skills aimed to create simpler stimuli such as convergent thinking (e.g. asking the teacher for clarification or doodling). It is important to note that if overstimulation becomes more stressful, creative behaviors because they depend on cognition, may be negatively affected (even if the motivation would remain high).

> Understimulation provoked by a dull environment would lead to (1) a decrease in exploratory behaviors toward simple stimuli, (2) an increase in exploratory behaviors toward complexity or novelty (e.g. focus on the teacher lesson rather than the classroom posters), and (3) an increase in thinking skills aimed at creating complex stimuli such as divergent thinking (e.g. asking the teacher open questions, or finding a pun).



## BLACK not white background

### Red light general, also

### OPTIMUM TEMP, Cold a little more Ptroductive

### Also mentioned glancingly high ceilings, or 
This is the so called Cathedral effect... no fMRI or more substantial evidence


[Link to Ebay Glass Board]()
<br> Details regarding this board, its dimensions 48" x 36", four glass holes to mount, not too thick, mounted using metal mounts and ?? screws, and magnetic, easy to clean due to the glass surface... very reflective wahhh the downside it is too reflective.

### Black spaces inbetween standard
Personally believe the way information is even presented, is like a top-down visual cue to reorient our attention and helps with creativity...
<br> Find myself, either from reduced eye strain, or due to the inversion from the typical white background black-focused print of books and online articles, that the inversion personally helps me with focusing on the spaces inbetween words. It's like it forces my attentional and thinking patterns to shift. 
<br> Find analagous forms in other cultures, for example in carved stone calligraphy in Taiwanese culture, find that the typical red ink on carved stone is like a stamp calligraphy, it many artistic implications. Within stamp calligraphy the two main forms are yin and yang, with the the yang technique has the words inhabiting the 'positive' and this is achieved through a emboss of the characters carved into stone. And the yin technique has the words inhabiting the 'negative' on the printed page so the deboss of the character is carved into the stone. And so the same effect as having a black background in print is also achieved. The philosophy on when and why calligraphists choose yin or yang print, is lost on me... I don't know enough yet 
<br> A last note as well, anecdotally physics professors have , it's chalk or die for them, whether that is stubbornness linked to traditions and mentors, or a deeper underlying preference for expansive attention to solve creatively, who's to say?
