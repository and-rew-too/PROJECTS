# Motivation
easy, inexpensive and quickly turns food waste into nutrient-rich compost to help your garden thrive... Reduces food waste mainly and feel better about environment.

<br> It's compact and tidy (wormy friends can eat their body weight in food in a day!!), making it easy to vermicompost in a wide variety of living situations.

# Setup
## Drainage
BINS must be breathable, so either three d print it with a ton of small holes, or if purchasing a large airtight container make sure to drill small holes on the side
<br> Top holes often lead to rain issues water logging, and small holes on side near the top handles is ideal.
<br>
<br> (1000 individual worms) aka 16oz of worms per 35 gallon bin, and this when scaled down translates to 1/2oz of worms for every gallon container. 

## 'Browns'
Wrigling friends can handle, sawdust (THIS IS KEY I hate wasting my vacuumed up wood scraps post woodworking) Other options include shredded brown or newspaper, rehydrated coco coir, dry leaves, dried grass, brown paper bags, straw, shredded cardboard.
Please avoid the peat moss as it ends up being too acidic. Bedding helps to start with maintenance, bulk up and prevent any bad odors, and also helps reduce the humidity levels overall... 
Bedding is used both to start a bin and also added later for routine maintenance. Owners of the website above, use a combination of coco coir and shredded newspaper to set the bing up and then switching to newspaper and dry leaves after. 

## 'Grit'
Very small amounts of pebbles or sand, like fiber for 'em. 

## 'Greens'
Any vegetable peels!



# Bedding
## Watering
How cna you tell if the box is too dry for the worms? 
<br> and if it is too dry, can add spritzes of water,a lthough based on comments with STL most three d printed parts end up as poor ventilation,  and trapping to much moisture is a more commonly faced problem. 
<br> How can you tell if the box is too wet for the womrs?
## Temperature
Optimum temperature range for red wigglers is between 55F and 85F, will die if exposed too long to temps above 95F during summers.  

## Humidity
<br> The ideal humidity is like a lightly wrung out sponge when you pick it up. 

# Foods
## Foods to avoid
Meat. Dairy. Citrus. Capsaicin (hurts their stomachs !) Heavy starches like vegetables or processed foods (think potato or mac and cheese or pasta)  

## Foods to give, 
Any fruits and vegetables.

## Foods to check
meat, very small amounts, issue is more the stench on meat that spoils faster and is slow to get digested by the worms.
Meat often found together with fat, and fat goes racid extremely fast
