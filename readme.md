Every repo contains a README, which is a document that is intended to explain, at first glance, what a project does and how to install or test the code. We recommend the following sections.

## Introduction and Relevant Links
Here is the IC being used, and a link to relevant information on how to care for indoor plants and measurements of 
Important: Must use aluminum channel for proper heatsinking. 


## BOM
Spreadsheet must be uploaded with .csv format, using top column for headers and have at a minimum
* **Part
* **Dim/Package
* **Unit Cost
* **Units
* **Cost
* **Supplier
* **Link
(No need to include pricing for common items sold >100 packs like resistors, screws, etc)


## Descriptions to add Below
* **What is the goal of this project?**  
* **What are the relevant files needed to recreate all items from scratch**
* ** Brainstorming photographs and sketches
* ** A minimum BOM and cost, kicad file, etc
* ** Attached any relevant code related to functioning of materials

## Results and Improvements


**Example:** The [README for 18Fâ€™s Midas project](https://github.com/18f/midas) starts out by answering the questions:
## Instructions for how to develop, use, and test the code.

**Example: Code below** 
```shell
docker build -f ./Dockerfile -t 18fgsa/analytics.usa.gov:<version> .
docker build -f ./Dockerfile.production -t 18fgsa/analytics.usa.gov:<version>-production .
```
**Example:** The README for analytics.usa.gov contains detailed instructions for [developing the site](https://github.com/18f/analytics.usa.gov#setup) and [deploying the site](https://github.com/18f/analytics.usa.gov#deploying-to-staging-18f-specific).
