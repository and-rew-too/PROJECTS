## IMPROVEMENTS
Troubleshooting faulty PIR when buying in bulk with varying build quality

Must have the reset time turned to minimum by adjusting the 10kOhm potentiometer
Must ensure that the mosfet turn-on voltage is compatible with the <5V signal from the PIR
Must build a better enclosure to prevent wiring from being accessible
Must have a more secure mounting for the LEDs as it is the least secured component

Tip: PIR sensors will have turn on time of 30-60s where calibration is still in progress and will give false positives
Tip: Can use IR-opaque tape to cover any portion of the sensor, so only motion from a selected portion of of the "room" is picked up
