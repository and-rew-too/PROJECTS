Lightweight and compact , easily extendible, with foot pedal integrated LED and digital readout for easy and accurate hole drilling in wood, plastic, soft metals... plan on adding a clamping system as well. 

## Introduction and Relevant Links
Power should be twisted cables... 
<br> Curently using and old dewalt , non brushless motor with keyless chuck. RPM range is from 0-1400. 
<br> Important: include commercial alternative links.

## BOM
See bom above, still incomplete
