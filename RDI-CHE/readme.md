Enclosure designed to cycle between 20? RH and 80RH and account for the linear expansion within wood products due to humidity, down to a 5um resolution. 


## Introduction and Relevant Links
Power is going to be either 12V or 24V. 
Amperage is 
Other powering supplies include an arduino nano, a small MG996 Servo, and a ultrasonic humdifier disc. 

Including information on expected CHE values
Inlcuding information on calculating the weight of water in the air (g/cm3) using RH. 
Including information on repeatability and tracking of the magnetostrictive linear position sensor.

## Gerber (PCB) Files
KiCad file name is to be completed

## Descriptions???

## Results and Improvements
Include temperature control as well, crucial for the RH stability as warmer air can hold less water vapor.
